## Corne Choc 

I've recently built a Corne Choc 3x6 with Kailh Hotswaps using Silver switches.

This is a forked repository from ![QMK Firmware](https://github.com/qmk/qmk_firmware/) public GitHub repository.
QMK is a keyboard firmware based on the [tmk\_keyboard firmware](https://github.com/tmk/tmk_keyboard) with some useful features for Atmel AVR and ARM controllers, and more specifically, the [OLKB product line](https://olkb.com), the [ErgoDox EZ](https://ergodox-ez.com) keyboard, and the [Clueboard product line](https://clueboard.co).


#TODO Add image here with my Corne Choc built

### Layout

I've used [Keyboard Layout Editor](www.keyboard-layout-editor.com) to create an image of my keyboard layout. 

I'm currently using Dvorak and I added some custom keymaps.

#TODO Add image of Layer 0 (base)
#TODO Add image of Layer 1
#TODO Add image of Layer 2

If you have a Corne Choc 3x6 keyboard and you want to use the same layout in the users/salorak/keympas
